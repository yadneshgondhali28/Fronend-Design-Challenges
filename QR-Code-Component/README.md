## Overview

This was a first challenge i have completed by front-end mentor. It was fun to create.
In this challenge i need to create a QR Code COmponent that can be easily viewed with desktop and mobile devices.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Due to this challenge i again face the problem of how to center a div inside a container. I dont why i always face this issue even i know how to center a div. I also face the problem of having accurate font, style and positioning before, but thanks to the fronend mentor b'coz they already provided all the information in the Readme.md file. For font i used the fonfinder extension to get the accurate font.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<main>
  <section class="container">
    <article class="qr-code-container">
      <div class="qr-img-container">
        <img class="qr-img" src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code" />
      </div>
      <h2 class="main-text">
        Improve your front-end skills by building projects
      </h2>
      <p class="sub-text">
        Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to
        the next level
      </p>
    </article>
  </section>
</main>
```

```css
.qr-code-container {
  width: 320px;
  padding: 17px 17px 40px;
  border-radius: 24px;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 36px 3px hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I will love to play more with CSS Flex-box.
